Card shuffling:

This project contains a C-code implementation of an algorithm to shuffle a deck of 'N' cards in a certain manner and find the number of rounds required to restore the deck back to it's original order.

It uses the concept of permutation cycles and a LinkedList data structure to form an O(nlogn) complexity algorithm.
